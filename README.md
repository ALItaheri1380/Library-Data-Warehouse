# Library Data Warehouse

This repository contains the implementation of a data warehouse system designed for managing and analyzing data related to a library system. The goal of this project is to build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that aggregates data from different sources and stores it in a well-structured data warehouse, allowing for efficient querying and analysis.

## Introduction

The Library Data Warehouse project aims to create a comprehensive data warehouse for a library system. The system integrates data from various sources, processes it through an ETL pipeline, and stores it in a structured format to support business intelligence and reporting.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
Library-Data-Warehouse/
│
├── data/                # Raw data and data sources
├── etl/                 # ETL scripts and processes
├── sql/                 # SQL scripts for data warehouse management
├── models/              # Data models and schemas
├── reports/             # Analysis and reporting scripts
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies and tools:

- **SQLSERVER**: All the codes of this project are written with sql server


## Usage

After setting up the project, you can use the following commands to interact with the data warehouse:

- **Running ETL**: Use the ETL scripts in the `etl/` directory to extract, transform, and load data into the warehouse.
- **Querying Data**: Use the SQL scripts in the `sql/` directory to query data from the warehouse.

## ETL Process

The ETL process in this project involves the following steps:

1. **Extract**: Data is extracted from various sources such as CSV files, APIs, or databases.
2. **Transform**: The extracted data is cleaned, transformed, and organized into a suitable format for loading into the data warehouse.
3. **Load**: The transformed data is loaded into the PostgreSQL data warehouse, structured according to the defined data models.

## Data Model

The data warehouse is designed to accommodate the following entities:

- **Books**: Information about books available in the library.
- **Authors**: Details about authors of the books.
- **Members**: Data about library members.
- **Borrowing**: Records of books borrowed by members.

The data model is designed to be scalable and supports efficient querying for reporting purposes.
